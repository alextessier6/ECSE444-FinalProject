# ECSE444 - Microprocessors @ McGill
The final project consisted of performing blind source separation using Fast Independent Component Analysis (FastICA) on a Cortex M4 processor.

Mixed sine waves were generated and then separated using FastICA, with each signal being outputted to a different audio channel.
